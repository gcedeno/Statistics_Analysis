# Description
> This project is connected with the Introduction to Data Analysis course and is part of the Data Analyst nanodegree program offered by Udacity. I will be using one of the available dataset options taken from the site <a href="https://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a>. This <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer">European Soccer Database</a> has more than 25,000 matches and more than 10,000 players for European professional soccer seasons from 2008 to 2016.
>The database is stored in a SQLite database. DB Browser was used to access database files, check the DB Schema, understand the data and checking SQL Queries.
> The goal of this project is to better understand the data analysis process and get hands on experience using Python analytical and visualization libraries like `NumPy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` as well as `SQL`. The connection between Python and SQL for quering and fetching data from a Database is also an import learning experience from this project.The simple analytical process will include some steps for exploring  and cleaning the dataset and some steps for exploratory data analysis. The use of advanced inferential statistics methods and machine learning are not part of the analysis, so the findings are tentative and do not go beyond an exploratory data analysis process.

>Answering two research questions is the main purpose of the exploratory data analysis, namely:
> * Research Question 1: What team attributes lead to the most victories?
> * Research Question 2: What team attributes contribute to scoring more goals?


### Data Source
<br>
<ol>
<li>Data taken from: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer">https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer</a></li>
</ol>

### Python Libraries
<br> For the analysis, the following python libraries are used:
<ul>
<li><b>sqlite3</b> for interacting with a local relational database.</li>
<li><b>pandas</b> and <b>numpy</b> for data ingestion and manipulation.</li>
<li><b>matplotlib</b> and <b>seaborn</b> for data visualization.</li>
<li>specific statistical methods from <b>scipy</b> and
<li><b>jupyter notebook</b>, for code development and analysis description.</li>

</ul>
