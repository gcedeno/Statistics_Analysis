# Description

This project corresponds to the Applied Statistics section of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The objective is to get some practice performing A/B tests in a real business situation.

For this project, it is required to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to work through the Jupyter notebook and help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Python Libraries

<ul>
<li><b>pandas</b> and <b>numpy</b> for data ingestion and manipulation.</li>
<li><b>matplotlib</b> and <b>seaborn</b> for data visualization.</li>
<li>specific statistical methods from <b>scipy</b> and
